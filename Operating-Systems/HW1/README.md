SearchText in Linux

The project was my homework for operating systems course. It is used to search text in a folder and in its sub directories. It is consisting of 2 parts like recursive solution and multiprocess solution.

Usage: Program takes two arguments. First one is the directory and second one is the text.

./a.out directory something

Example:

./program_name /var/lib searchMe
